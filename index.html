              JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The
              programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
              right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page
              loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t
              need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect,
              JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with
                a database, provide continuity of information from one
                invocation to another of the application, or perform file
                manipulations on a server.
              </li>

              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model
                (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>

              <li>
                When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
                “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
                decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother”
                of Java would help.
              </li>

              <li>
                But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent
                language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now
                it has no relation to Java at all.
              </li>

              <li>
                Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also
                on the server, or actually on any device that has a special
                program called the JavaScript engine.

            Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve already seen a statement, <code class="first-alert">alert('Hello, world!')</code>,
            which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements
            can be separated with a semicolon.
          </p>
          <p>For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:</p>
          <code>alert('Hello');</code>
          <code>alert('World');</code>
          <p>
            Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code
            more readable:
          </p>
          <code>alert('Hello');</code>
          <code>alert('World');</code>

            A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.

            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>

            <li>
              Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
              one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

            A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to
            store goodies, visitors, and other data. To create a variable in
            JavaScript, use the let keyword. The statement below creates (in
            other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:
          </p>

          <code>let message;</code>
          <p>
            Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator
            =:
          </p>

          <code
            >let message; message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the
            variable named message</code
          >

          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. In contrast to Java's
            compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types
            representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
            prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based
            object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
            objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
            declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
            executing as loosely typed methods. JavaScript is a very free-form
            language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
            classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether
            methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
            implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
            types are not explicitly typed.

            This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language
            itself. But we need a working environment to run our scripts and,
            since this book is online, the browser is a good choice. We’ll keep
            the amount of browser-specific commands (like alert) to a minimum so
            that you don’t spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on
            another environment (like Node.js). We’ll focus on JavaScript in the
            browser in the next part of the tutorial. So first, let’s see how we
            attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like
            Node.js), you can execute the script with a command like "node
            my.js".
